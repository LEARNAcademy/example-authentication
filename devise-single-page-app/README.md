# Devise and the Single Page App

In this example, we bring all of the concepts we've been working with into one fully functional, full stack application.  We'll use Rails to differentiate between protected and public routes, Devise to handle authentication, and a React Single Page App do do the UI work.

We'll pick this app up where the Devise Example app leaves off.  At the start, we have:

* A functioning Rails 5 application
* Devise and a User Model for authentication
* A Bike resource associated to Users.
* Scaffolded Controller and Views for Bikes

## About the Git Branches
* 'master' has the completed project
* 'single-page-app-starting-point' is where this example picks up.  If you are following along, checkout that branch, and start coding from there.
