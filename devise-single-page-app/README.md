# Single Page App Authentication

This example takes a look at how we log users into an application.  We start off with a discussion of a few concepts around authentication and authorization.  It's important to make the distinction clearly.

* [Authentication](./02-authentication.md) (independent reading)

## Devise
We turn our attention to a base install of Devise, a popular Rails authentication gem, and explore how Devise works in an app that doesn't use React.

#### Group Work
